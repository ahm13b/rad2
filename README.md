Redesigning a database interface


The idea was to take common task, such as sending certifications to end-users and resetting passwords, to the forefront. With my team's design, workers no longer have to click through numerous screens in order to accomplish those common task.


##Goals

1. Increase workflow
2. App must have a modern look and feel
3. Built upon Bootstrap v4
4. Login system for employees
5. Results populate while typing
